### a.) Kurtosis

__(1 point)__

```


```{r Part_1a_kurtosis}

pretty_vector(c(Kurtosis = rockchalk::kurtosis(mydata$Ratio)))

```

### b.) Log Scale

__(2 points)__

+ Tranform RATIO using *log10()* to create L_RATIO (Kabacoff Section 8.5.2, p. 199-200). 
+ Form a histogram and QQ plot using __L_RATIO__. 
+ Calculate the skewness and kurtosis.

```

### c.) Bartlett's Test
__(1 point)__

+ Test the homogeneity of variance across classes using *bartlett.test()* 

_(Kabacoff Section 9.2.2, p. 222)._

```{r Part_1c}

bartless.l_ratio <- bartlett.test(L_Ratio ~ Class, data = mydata)

qqPlot(lm(L_Ratio ~ Class, data = mydata),
	simulate = T, main = "QQ-Plot L_Ratio", labels = F)

bartless.l_ratio

pretty_vector(c(P_Value = ifelse(bartless.l_ratio$p.value < 0.05, "Reject Null", "Cannot Reject Null")))

bartlett.ratio <- bartlett.test( Ratio ~ Class, data = mydata)

qqPlot(lm(Ratio ~ Class, data = mydata),
	simulate = T, main = "QQ-Plot Ratio", labels = F)

bartlett.ratio

pretty_vector(c(P_Value = ifelse(bartlett.ratio$p.value < 0.05, "Reject Null", "Cannot Reject Null")))

```

**Question (2 points):  Based on steps 1.a, 1.b and 1.c, which variable RATIO or L_RATIO exhibits better conformance to a normal distribution with homogeneous variances across age classes?  Why?** 

__Answer:__

__L_Ratio__ exhibits better conformance to normality across classes due to the QQ-Plots falling closer in-line with the expected quantiles, lower Kurtosis, as well as having a less skewed 
distribution as observed by both the skewness measure and the histograms of the respective variables. Finally, at 0.05 significance level, we cannot reject the null hypothesis that
L_Ratio comes from a normal distribution according to Bartless's Test for Equality of Variances, which we must do for Ratio as if falls well short of significance.

## 2.) Analysis of Variance

### a.) ANOVA

__(2 points)__

+ Perform an analysis of variance with *aov()* on L_RATIO using CLASS and SEX as the independent variables _(Kabacoff chapter 9, p. 212-229)_. 
+ Assume equal variances. 
+ Perform two analyses. 
+ First, fit a model _with_ the interaction term __CLASS:SEX__. 
+ Then, fit a model _without_ __CLASS:SEX__. 
+ Use *summary()* to obtain the analysis of variance tables (_Kabacoff chapter 9, p. 227_).

```{r Part_2a}

get_anova <- function(model, data) {
	lm.fit <- lm(model, data)
	anova <- aov(lm.fit)
	anova.sum <- summary(anova)

	as.data.table(cbind(Variable = c(attr(lm.fit$terms, "term.labels"), "Residuals"), rbindlist(anova.sum)))
}

# w/ Interaction Term
model_1 <- { L_Ratio ~ Class * Sex }
anova_1 <- get_anova(model_1, mydata)
pretty_kable(anova_1, pretty_vector(model_1), dig = 4)

# No Interaction Term
model_2 <- { L_Ratio ~ Class + Sex }
anova_2 <- get_anova(model_2, mydata)
pretty_kable(anova_2, pretty_vector(model_2), dig = 4)

```

**Question (2 points):  Compare the two analyses.  What does the non-significant interaction term suggest about the relationship between L_RATIO and the factors CLASS and SEX?**

__Answer:__

It means the join effect of Class and Sex is not statistically higher than the sum of both effect individually.

### b.) Tukey
__(2 points)__

+ For the model without __CLASS:SEX__ (i.e. an interaction term), obtain multiple comparisons with the *TukeyHSD()* function. 
+ Interpret the results at the 95% confidence level (*TukeyHSD()* will adjust for unequal sample sizes). 

```{r Part_2b}

tukey.results <- TukeyHSD(aov(model_2, data = mydata))

pretty_kable(tukey.results$Class, "Tukey Class", dig = 3)

pretty_kable(tukey.results$Sex, "Tukey Sex", dig = 3)

```

**Question (2 points):  first, interpret the trend in coefficients across age classes. What is this indicating about L_RATIO?  Second, do these results suggest male and female abalones can be combined into a single category labeled as 'adults?' If not, why not?**

__Answer:__

The trends in age class is interesting in that A3, A4 and A5 are not significantly different from each other. By this I mean that A3, A4 and A5 all show no significant differences ( p < 0.05 ) 
to any other class or each other ( p < 0.05 ). This suggests that we could choose to combine A1 and A2 into a single class if we wanted to for further analysis.

Secondly, Male and Female abalones have a .941 similarity in means, suggesting they're well beyond statistically significant, almost to the point of being identical. It would
be logical to just combine them and split the abalones into Infants and Adults for ratio analysis.

```{r question_2a_support}

tukey.class <- as.data.table(tukey.results$Class)
tukey.class <- tukey.class[, lapply(.SD, as.numeric), .SDcols = colnames(tukey.class)[1:4]]
tukey.class <- cbind(row.names(tukey.results$Class), tukey.class)

colnames(tukey.class) <- c("Class", "diff", "lwr", "upr", "p_adj")

ggplot(tukey.class, aes(x = Class, y = p_adj)) +
	geom_point(color = "steelblue", size = 4) +
	geom_hline(yintercept = 0.05, lwd = 1, color = "firebrick3") +
	labs(title = "p values for Tukey Test", subtitle = "95% Confidence Level", caption = "L_Ratio ~ Class", x = " Class ",  y = " p value ")

with(mydata, plotmeans(L_Ratio ~ Class))

opar <- par(las = 2)
par(mar=c(5,8,4,2))
plot(tukey.results)
par(opar)

```

-----

## 3.) Infant / Adult

### a.) Type

__(2 points)__

+ Use *combineLevels()* from the 'rockchalk' package to combine "M" and "F" into a new level, "ADULT". This will necessitate defining a new variable, TYPE, in mydata which will have two levels:  "I" and "ADULT". 
+ Present side-by-side histograms of VOLUME. 
+ One should display infant volumes and, the other, adult volumes. 

```{r Part_3a}

# capture the output from combineLevels into a throw-away variable.
discard <- capture.output( mydata$Type <- combineLevels(mydata$Sex, c("Male", "Female"), "Adult") )

stopifnot(sum(mydata$Type == "Adult") == 707)
stopifnot(sum(mydata$Type == "Infant") == 329)

infants <- mydata[mydata$Type == "Infant"]

stopifnot(nrow(infants) == 329)

ggplot(infants, aes(Volume, fill = ..count..)) +
	geom_histogram(breaks = pretty(infants$Volume)) +
	labs(title = "Histogram of Infant Volume", caption = "MSDS 401: Data Analysis #3, Q3.a")

adults <- mydata[mydata$Type == "Adult"]

stopifnot(nrow(adults) == 707)

ggplot(adults, aes(Volume, fill = ..count..)) +
	geom_histogram(breaks = pretty(infants$Volume)) +
	labs(title = "Histogram of Adult Volume", caption = "MSDS 401: Data Analysis #3, Q3.a")

```

**Question (2 points): Compare the histograms.  How do the distributions differ? Are there going to be any difficulties separating infants from adults based on VOLUME?**

__Answer:__

The two distributions have distinct shapes, however, there is a significant amout of overlap in the 0 - 500 range. An abalone having volume > 500 we could assume with relative
saftey would be adult, however, there are a significant amount of both infant and adult abalone in the lower range. Around 90% of infant abalone have a Volume measure
that's less than the lower 50% of adult abalones, giving us reason to be concerned about overlap here.


```{r question_3a_support}

pretty_vector(c("Adult" = quantile(adults$Volume, c(.50, .75))))
pretty_vector(c("Adult" = quantile(infants$Volume, c(.50, .90))))

```

### b.) Shuck ~ Volume
__(3 points)__

+ Create a scatterplot of __SHUCK__ versus __VOLUME__ and a scatterplot of their base ten logarithms, labeling the variables as __L_SHUCK__ and __L_VOLUME__. 
+ Please be aware the variables, __L_SHUCK__ and __L_VOLUME__, present the data as orders of magnitude (i.e. VOLUME = 100 = 10^2 becomes L_VOLUME = 2). 
+ Use color to differentiate __CLASS__ in the plots. 
+ Repeat using color to differentiate by __TYPE__. 

```{r Part_3b}

mydata$L_Shuck <- log10(mydata$Shuck)
mydata$L_Volume <- log10(mydata$Volume)

q3b_1 <- ggplot(mydata, aes(x = Volume, y = Shuck, color = Class)) +
   geom_point() +
   labs(title = "Shuck ~ Volume, Standard")

q3b_2 <- ggplot(mydata, aes(x = L_Volume, y = L_Shuck, color = Class)) +
   geom_point() +
   scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0.5, 3)) +
   labs(title = "Shuck ~ Volume, Logarithmic")

grid.arrange(q3b_1, q3b_2, nrow = 1)

q3b_3 <- ggplot(mydata, aes(x = Volume, y = Shuck, color = Type)) +
   geom_point() +
   labs(title = "Shuck ~ Volume, Standard")

q3b_4 <- ggplot(mydata, aes(x = L_Volume, y = L_Shuck, color = Type)) +
   geom_point() +
   scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0.5, 3)) +
   labs(title = "Shuck ~ Volume, Logarithmic")

grid.arrange(q3b_3, q3b_4, nrow = 1)

```

**Question (3 points):  Compare the two scatterplots. What effect(s) does log-transformation appear to have on the variability present in the plot?  What are the implications for linear regression analysis? Where do the various CLASS levels appear in the plots? Where do the levels of TYPE appear in the plots?**

***Answer: (Enter your answer here.)***

-----

## 4.) Age Class

### a.) 
__(3 points)__

+ Since abalone growth slows after class __A3__, infants in classes __A4 and A5__ are considered mature and candidates for harvest. 
+ Reclassify the infants in classes __A4 and A5__ as _ADULTS_.
+ This reclassification can be achieved using *combineLevels()*, but only on the abalones in classes __A4 and A5__. 
+ You will use this recoded TYPE variable, in which the infants in __A4__ and __A5__ are reclassified as _ADULTS_, for the remainder of this data analysis assignment.

+ Regress __L_SHUCK__ as the dependent variable on __L_VOLUME__, __CLASS__ and __TYPE__ (Kabacoff Section 8.2.4, p. 178-186, the Data Analysis Video #2 and Black Section 14.2). 
+ Use the multiple regression model: __L_SHUCK ~ L_VOLUME + CLASS + TYPE__. 
+ Apply *summary()* to the model object to produce results.

<br />

```{r Part_4a}

mydata[Type == "Infant" & Class %in% c("A4", "A5"), Type := "Adult"]

lm.model <- { L_Shuck ~ L_Volume + Class + Type }

__Question (3 points):__  

+ What is revealed by the displays and calculations in __(5)(a)__ and __(5)(b)__? 
+ Does the model 'fit'?  
+ Does this analysis indicate that L_VOLUME, and ultimately VOLUME, might be useful for harvesting decisions? 
+ __Discuss.__

***Answer: (Enter your answer here.)***

-----

There is a tradeoff faced in managing abalone harvest. The infant population must be protected since it represents future harvests. On the other hand, the harvest should be designed to be efficient with a yield to justify the effort. This assignment will use VOLUME to form binary decision rules to guide harvesting. If VOLUME is below a "cutoff" (i.e. a specified volume), that individual will not be harvested. If above, it will be harvested. Different rules are possible.

The next steps in the assignment will require consideration of the proportions of infants and adults harvested at different cutoffs. 

+ For this, similar "for-loops" will be used to compute the harvest proportions. These loops must use the same values for the constants min.v and delta and use the same statement "for(k in 1:10000)." 
+ Otherwise, the resulting infant and adult proportions cannot be directly compared and plotted as requested. Note the example code supplied below.

-----

## 6.) Optimal Harvesting

### a.) Split Values

__(2 points)__

A series of volumes covering the range from minimum to maximum abalone volume will be used in a "for loop" to determine how the harvest proportions change as the "cutoff" changes. Code for doing this is provided.

```{r Part_6a}

idxi <- mydata$Type == "Infant"
idxa <- mydata$Type == "Adult"

max.v <- max(mydata$Volume)
min.v <- min(mydata$Volume)
delta <- (max.v - min.v)/10000
prop.infants <- numeric(10000)
prop.adults <- numeric(10000)
volume.value <- numeric(10000)

total.infants <- sum(idxi)
total.adults <- sum(idxa)

for (k in 1:10000) { 
	value <- min.v + k*delta
	volume.value[k] <- value
	prop.infants[k] <- sum(mydata$Volume[idxi] <= value) / total.infants
	prop.adults[k] <- sum(mydata$Volume[idxa] <= value) / total.adults
}

# prop.infants shows the impact of increasing the volume cutoff for
# harvesting. The following code shows how to "split" the population at
# a 50% harvest of infants.

n.infants <- sum(prop.infants <= 0.5)
split.infants <- min.v + (n.infants + 0.5)*delta  # This estimates the desired volume.

pretty_vector( c( "Infant Split" = split.infants ) )

n.adults <- sum(prop.adults <= 0.5)
split.adults <- min.v + (n.adults + 0.5)*delta

pretty_vector( c( "Adult Split" = split.adults ) )

```

### b.) Split Visual

__(2 points)__

Present a plot showing the infant proportions and the adult proportions versus volume.value. Compute the 50% "split" volume.value for each and show on the plot.   

```{r Part_6b}

harvest.prop <- data.table( Infant = prop.infants, Adult = prop.adults, Volume = volume.value)

harvest.prop[, ':='(InfantDelta = abs(Volume - split.infants), AdultDelta = abs(Volume - split.adults))]

split.infants.y <- harvest.prop[ InfantDelta == min(harvest.prop$InfantDelta)]$Infant
split.adults.y <- first(harvest.prop[ AdultDelta == min(harvest.prop$AdultDelta) ]$Adult)

offset.x <- 25
offset.y <- .035

ggplot(harvest.prop) +
   geom_point(aes(x = Volume, y = Adult, color = "Adults")) +
   geom_point(aes(x = Volume, y = Infant, color = "Infants")) +
   geom_hline(yintercept = 0.5, color = "black", lwd = .9) +
   scale_color_manual(values = c("steelblue3", "firebrick3")) +
   geom_vline(xintercept = split.infants, lwd = .9, color = "darkgreen",, linetype = 11) +
   geom_vline(xintercept = split.adults, lwd = .9, color = "darkgreen",, linetype = 11) +
   geom_text(x = split.infants + offset.x, y = split.infants.y - offset.y, label = round(split.infants, 2)) +
   geom_text(x = split.adults + offset.x, y = split.adults.y - offset.y, label = round(split.adults, 2)) +
   labs(title = "Propotion of Adults and Infants Protected", y = "Proportion")

```

**Question (2 points):  The two 50% "split" values serve a descriptive purpose illustrating the difference between the populations. What do these values suggest regarding possible cutoffs for harvesting?** 

From the information displayed, it would suggest to me that infants will be harvested 

-----

This part will address the determination of a volume.value corresponding to the observed maximum difference in harvest percentages of adults and infants. 
To calculate this result, the vectors of proportions from item __(6)__ must be used. 
These proportions must be converted from "not harvested" to "harvested" proportions by using *(1 - prop.infants)* for infants, and *(1 - prop.adults)* for adults. 
The reason the proportion for infants drops sooner than adults is that infants are maturing and becoming adults with larger volumes.

-----

## 7.) Harvest Proportions

### a.) Difference
__(1 point)__

+ Evaluate a plot of the difference *((1 - prop.adults) - (1 - prop.infants))* versus volume.value. 
+ Compare to the 50% "split" points determined in __(6)(a)__. 
+ There is considerable variability present in the peak area of this plot. 
+ The observed "peak" difference may not be the best representation of the data. 
+ One solution is to smooth the data to determine a more representative estimate of the maximum difference.

```{r Part_7a}

prop.diff <- data.table( Volume = volume.value, Diff = ((1 - prop.adults) - (1 - prop.infants)))

ggplot(prop.diff) +
	geom_point(aes(x = Volume, y = Diff), color = "firebrick", lwd = .85) +
	labs(title = "Difference in Harvest Proportions", y = "Difference in Proportions Harvested")

```

### b.) Smoothed
__(1 point)__

+ Since curve smoothing is not studied in this course, code is supplied below. 
+ Execute the following code to create a smoothed curve to append to the plot in __(a)__. 
+ The procedure is to individually smooth (1-prop.adults) and (1-prop.infants) before determining an estimate of the maximum difference. 

```{r Part_7b}

y.loess.a <- loess(1 - prop.adults ~ volume.value, span = 0.25, family = c("symmetric"))
y.loess.i <- loess(1 - prop.infants ~ volume.value, span = 0.25, family = c("symmetric"))
smooth.difference <- predict(y.loess.a) - predict(y.loess.i)

offset.y <- .15

prop.diff$Smooth <- smooth.difference

smooth.max <- prop.diff[ Smooth == max(smooth.difference)]$Volume

ggplot(prop.diff) +
	geom_jitter(aes(x = Volume, y = Smooth), color = "steelblue3", lwd = .9) +
	geom_vline(xintercept = smooth.max, lwd = 1, linetype = 11, color = "steelblue") +
	geom_text(x = smooth.max + offset.x, y = split.adults.y - offset.y, angle = 90, label = paste("Volume = ", round(smooth.max, 3))) +
	labs(title = "Difference in Harvest Proportions", y = "Difference in Proportions Harvested")

```

### c.) Combined
__(3 points)__

+ Present a plot of the difference *((1 - prop.adults) - (1 - prop.infants))* versus volume.value with the variable smooth.difference superimposed. 
+ Determine the volume.value corresponding to the maximum smoothed difference (Hint: use *which.max()*). 
+ Show the estimated peak location corresponding to the cutoff determined.

```{r Part_7c}

ggplot(prop.diff) +
	geom_jitter(aes(x = Volume, y = Smooth), color = "steelblue3", lwd = .9) +
	geom_point(aes(x = Volume, y = Diff), color = "firebrick", lwd = .85) +
	geom_vline(xintercept = smooth.max, lwd = 1, linetype = 11, color = "steelblue") +
	geom_text(x = smooth.max + offset.x, y = split.adults.y - offset.y, angle = 90, label = paste("Volume = ", round(smooth.max, 3))) +
	labs(title = "Difference in Harvest Proportions", y = "Difference in Proportions Harvested")

```

### d.)
__(1 point)__

+ What separate harvest proportions for infants and adults would result if this cutoff is used? 
+ Show the separate harvest proportions (NOTE: the adult harvest proportion is the __"true positive rate"__ and the infant harvest proportion is the __"false positive rate"__).

Code for calculating the adult harvest proportion is provided.

```{r Part_7d}

(1 - prop.adults)[which.max(smooth.difference)]  # [1] 0.7416332

```

There are alternative ways to determine cutoffs. Two such cutoffs are described below.

-----

## 8.) Alternative Cutoffs

### a.)
__(2 points)__

Harvesting of infants in CLASS "A1" must be minimized. The smallest volume.value cutoff that produces a zero harvest of infants from CLASS "A1" may be used as a baseline for comparison with larger cutoffs. Any smaller cutoff would result in harvesting infants from CLASS "A1."  

Compute this cutoff, and the proportions of infants and adults with VOLUME exceeding this cutoff. Code for determining this cutoff is provided. Show these proportions.

```{r Part_8a}

volume.value[volume.value > max(mydata[mydata$Class == "A1" &
    mydata$Type == "Infant", "Volume"])][1] # [1] 206.786

```

### b.)
__(2 points)__

Another cutoff is one for which the proportion of adults not harvested equals the proportion of infants harvested. 

+ This cutoff would equate these rates; effectively, our two errors:  'missed' adults and wrongly-harvested infants. 
+ This leaves for discussion which is the greater loss: a larger proportion of adults not harvested or infants harvested?  
+ This cutoff is 237.7383. 
+ Calculate the separate harvest proportions for infants and adults using this cutoff. Show these proportions.  

_Code for determining this cutoff is provided._

```{r Part_8b}

volume.value[which.min(abs(prop.adults - (1-prop.infants)))] # [1] 237.6391

```

-----

## 9.)

### a.) 
__(6 points)__

+ Construct an ROC curve by plotting (1 - prop.adults) versus (1 - prop.infants). 
+ Each point which appears corresponds to a particular volume.value. 
+ Show the location of the cutoffs determined in (7) and (8) on this plot and label each. 

```{r Part_9}


```

### b.) 
__(1 point)__

+ Numerically integrate the area under the ROC curve and report your result. This is most easily done with the *auc()* function from the "flux" package. 
+ Areas-under-curve, or AUCs, greater than 0.8 are taken to indicate good discrimination potential. 

```{r Part_9b}

## 10.)

### a.)
__(3 points)__

Prepare a table showing each cutoff along with the following:
+ 1.) true positive rate (1-prop.adults,
+ 2.) false positive rate (1-prop.infants),
+ 3.) harvest proportion of the total population
 	
```{r Part_10}

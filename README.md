# R Playground

Various scripts to keep track of my R work. 

Some of the scripts are from working through examples on:

DataCamp (https://www.datacamp.com)
Intro to Statistics with R (http://www.springer.com/us/book/9780387790534)
Advanced R (http://adv-r.had.co.nz/)
Seamless R and C++ integration with RCpp (http://www.rcpp.org/book/)

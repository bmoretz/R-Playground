R Playground

Various scripts to keep track of my R work. 

Some of the scripts are from working through examples on:

 <ul>
    <li>DataCamp (https://www.datacamp.com)</li>
    <li>Intro to Statistics with R (http://www.springer.com/us/book/9780387790534)</li>
    <li>Advanced R (http://adv-r.had.co.nz/)</li>
    <li>Seamless R and C++ integration with RCpp (http://www.rcpp.org/book/)</li>
    <li>Case Studies in Data Science with R (http://rdatasciencecases.org/)</li>
  </ul>
